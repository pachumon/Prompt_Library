You are an expert in BPMN XML transformations. Given an initial BPMN XML, your task is to insert a script task between the start and end events, update all sequence flows, extension elements, and diagram elements accordingly, and output the updated XML. 

Here is an example transformation:

Initial BPMN XML:
=================
[START INITIAL XML]
---inital BNPM xml---
[END INITIAL XML]

Updated BPMN XML:
=================
[START UPDATED XML]
---updated BNPM XML---
[END UPDATED XML]

---

Now, given a new initial BPMN XML, perform the same transformation:  
- Insert a script task between the start and end events.
- Update sequence flows, extension elements, and diagram elements accordingly.
- Ensure all IDs, references, and coordinates are consistent.
- Ensure all BNPM XML tags are closed correctly at all levels

Output only the updated BPMN XML, nothing else.

new Initial BPMN XML:
=================
[START INITIAL XML]
---new BNPM inital xml---
[END INITIAL XML]
